# Time Table Automator

## Project Overview

The **Time Table Automator** is an automated system designed to generate optimized timetables for scheduling classes in educational institutions. Utilizing algorithms to handle various constraints and preferences, this system aims to simplify the scheduling process, minimize conflicts, and enhance resource utilization. The project features a user-friendly interface for inputting requirements and a robust backend built with Python and MySQL for data management.

## Features

- **Automated Timetable Generation**: Algorithms that optimize class scheduling by analyzing user-defined constraints and available resources.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive front-end allowing users to easily input requirements and preferences for class scheduling.
- **Conflict Resolution**: The system automatically identifies and resolves conflicts, ensuring that no two classes are scheduled at the same time or in the same location.
- **Data Management**: A MySQL database for storing and managing class details, instructor information, and room availability, enabling efficient data retrieval and updates.
- **Customizable Constraints**: Users can set specific constraints, such as preferred time slots, limits on consecutive classes, and room requirements based on equipment or capacity.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface)
- **Backend**: Python (for logic processing)
- **Database**: MySQL (for data management)
- **Algorithms**: Custom algorithms for optimization and conflict resolution

## Installation

To run the **Time Table Automator** locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-table-automator.git
   cd time-table-automator
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a new database in MySQL.
   - Import the database schema from the provided SQL file (if available).

4. Configure the database connection settings in the Python backend.

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you have configured).
2. Use the front-end interface to input your class requirements, including:
   - Class names and durations
   - Instructor availability
   - Room preferences
3. Click the “Generate Timetable” button to create an optimized schedule based on your inputs.
4. Review the generated timetable and make adjustments as needed.

## Challenges Faced

- **Complexity of Scheduling**: Developing algorithms that effectively manage multiple constraints and conflicts was challenging. Iterative testing and refinement helped improve the algorithm's efficiency.
- **User Experience**: Gathering user feedback and incorporating it into the interface design was essential to ensure the tool met actual user needs and preferences.

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the application to increase accessibility for users on the go.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement data analytics features to provide insights into class attendance and resource usage.
- **Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS)**: Allow seamless integration with popular LMS platforms for enhanced functionality.
